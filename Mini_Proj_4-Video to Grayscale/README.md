# Mini_Project_in_Python-4-Converting_video_to_grayscale


This project converts a video to grayscale using opencv. The file 'convert_video_to_grayscale.py' is the python file to convert the video to grayscale. The 'colored_video_preview.mov' is the preview of the colored video and 'grayscale_video_preview.mov' is the preview of the grayscale video. The 'cmd.py' is the command line implementation of the above problem. The 'Result.png' tells us the time taken to convert the video to grayscale. 


# Install dependencies

pip install opencv-python 

# Time Taken

Time taken to conver  video to grayscale is 206.543 seconds. Generally, this time taken is directly propotional to the length of the video played as it converts the video frame by frame to grayscale and then displays it. 

# Command Line Solution

python <script_name>.py input_file_name

//This will output the video file in mp4 by the name of 'Gray video'
