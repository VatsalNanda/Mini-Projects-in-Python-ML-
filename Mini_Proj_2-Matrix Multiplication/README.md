# Mini_Project_in_Python-2-Matrix Multiplication with and without using Numpy

This project randomly creates matrices randomly of the desired size( as mentioned in the jupyter notebooks). The file 'Multiplication of 2 matrices (scalar and matrix) without numpy Library.ipynb' is a jupyter notebook and multiplies 2 matrices using the calar and cross product without using the numpy library. The file 'Multiplication (scalar and matrix) using Numpy Library.ipynb'is also a jupyter notebook and multiplies 2 matrices using the calar and cross product with using the numpy library. The file 'command_line_sol.py' is a command line solution of the above problem. The 'result images' folder consists of all the result images executed in the jupyter notebook.
