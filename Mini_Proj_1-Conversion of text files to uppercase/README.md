# Mini_Project_in_Python-1-Converting_text_files_to_uppercase

This is the first project in the series of Mini Projects in Python. In this project we create a text file of size approximately 10MB and copy it multiple times. The file can be copied any number of times depending upon the number of files you need to convert their content to uppercase. I am considering 500 files only. We also calculate the time taken at certain intervals. Here, I have calculated the time taken for 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 files. In the end, the graph is plotted and a table is created to visulaise the results. The 'main.py' has the main code. The 'main1.py' has the command line implementation of this code.
